  <h3>Bangkok BTS Skytrain</h3>
  <p>Over recent years and due to the over-congested roads in Bangkok, city planners have developed both an overground and underground train network through the city. The BTS Skytrain is an overground railway system comprised of the Sukhumvit Line and the Silom Line.</p>
  <p>This overground railway network stops off at many tourist areas and attractions in Bangkok and is very developed much like the large Western cities of the world making it very easy to find your way around the city.</p>
  <h3>For example:</h3>
  <ul>BTS Sukumwit line pass Siam paragon</ul>
  <ul>BTS Silom line pass Silom pass silom</ul>
  <ul>BTS Gold line pass Charoen Nakhoan</ul>
  <ul>BTS Blue line pass Lat Praw</ul>
  <ul>BTS Purple line pass Ministry of Public Health</ul>
  <ul> BTS airport rail link go straight to Suvarnabhumi International Airport</ul>

  <h3>Bangkok MRT Subway</h3>
  <p>The MRT Subway, otherwise known as the Blue Line, is the first underground railway line to be introduced to Bangkokâ€™s railway network. It comprises 18 stops and follows a slightly different route to the BTS Skytrain which allows travellers to commute via train to the inaccessible neighbourhoods of the Skytrain.
  </p>
  <p>Both the BTS and MRT intersect at various points allowing travellers from both lines greater variety when it comes to getting to their destination of choice. Both the BTS and MRT networks are in operation from 6 am to midnight Monday to Friday.</p>
  <h3>For example:</h3>
  <ul>Blue line pass Silom</ul>
  <ul>Purple line pass Ministry of public health</ul>
  <ul>Green line pass Bangna</ul>
  <ul>Silom line pass Silom</ul>
